Day  1: JavaScript Fundamentals (Building Blocks)
Objective: Introduce basic JavaScript concepts and how they form the foundation for managing an e-commerce site’s inventory.

Topics Covered:
Variables & Data Types
Introduction to let, const, and var.
Primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined.
Reference types: arrays, objects.

Example:
let productName = "Laptop";
const productPrice = 1000;

Functions
Function declaration and expressions, arrow functions.
Example:
function getProductDetails(productName, productPrice) {
    return `${productName} costs $${productPrice}`;
}

Loops and Conditionals
for, while loops, and conditionals.
Example: Looping through products.
let products = ["Laptop", "Phone", "Headphones"];
for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
    console.log(products[i]);
}

Hands-on Project:
Write a function to check if a product is in stock.
Display the names of all products in inventory using loops.

Homework:

Day  2: Arrays and Objects (Organizing Products)
Objective: Teach students how to organize products using arrays and objects.

Topics Covered:
Arrays
Creating and manipulating arrays: push, pop, shift, unshift.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let products = ["Laptop", "Phone", "Headphones"];
products.push("Tablet");
Objects
Defining objects to store product information.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let product = {
    name: "Laptop",
    price: 1000,
    stock: 20
};
Combining Arrays and Objects
Using arrays of objects to represent an inventory system.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let inventory = [
    { name: "Laptop", price: 1000, stock: 20 },
    { name: "Phone", price: 500, stock: 30 }
];
Hands-on Project:

products.sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price);
Searching

Searching for products using linear search and binary search.
Example (linear search):
javascript
Copy code
function findProduct(name) {
    for (let product of products) {
        if (product.name === name) return product;
    }
}
Hands-on Project:
Implement a binary search algorithm to find a product in an inventory list.
Sort the products by price or name.
Homework:
Solve problems on sorting and searching algorithms.



Day 4: Functions and Utilities (Reusable Logic)
Objective: Teach reusable functions and how to implement utilities for e-commerce features.

Topics Covered:
Reusable Functions

Functions for repetitive tasks like calculating discounts, prices, etc.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function applyDiscount(price, discount) {
    return price - (price * discount);
}
Higher-Order Functions

Using map, filter, and reduce for arrays.
Example using reduce:
javascript
Copy code
const totalStockValue = inventory.reduce((total, product) => total + product.price * product.stock, 0);
Hands-on Project:
Write a function to calculate the total revenue of products in stock.
Implement a discount for products under a certain price.
Homework:
Write a utility function to check the stock availability of multiple products at once.



Day 5: Advanced Problem-Solving (Dynamic Pricing)
Objective: Implement advanced concepts like dynamic pricing and cross-product discounts.

Topics Covered:
Dynamic Pricing

Implementing logic to apply different prices based on conditions (e.g., seasonal sales).
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function calculateFinalPrice(product) {
    if (product.stock > 10) {
        return applyDiscount(product.price, 0.1);
    }
    return product.price;
}
Cross-Product Discounts

Implement “Buy 1 Get 1 Free” or bulk purchase discounts.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function bulkDiscount(quantity, price) {
    if (quantity >= 5) return price * 0.8; // 20% off
    return price;
}
Hands-on Project:
Implement a feature to calculate the final price after applying discounts.
Create a function for a “Buy 1 Get 1 Free” offer.
Homework:
Implement a function that calculates the total cost of products in the cart, including discounts.



Day 6: HTML, CSS, and Basic JavaScript (Shop Window)
Objective: Teach the frontend basics, bringing the e-commerce site to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Topics Covered:
HTML

Structure for a product listing page with product name, price, and stock.
Example:
html
Copy code
<div class="product">
    <h2>Product Name</h2>
    <p>Price: $100</p>
    <button>Add to Cart</button>
</div>
CSS

Basic layout with Flexbox or Grid for displaying products.
Example:
css
Copy code
.product {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    margin: 10px;
}
JavaScript
